# File System Program

## Favour Ojo

## Series of Steps that You Will Perform During the Demonstration

1. I will be showing the code that I have written in the programming language
Python using the text editor Visual Studio Code.

2. I will then run the command `python pyremove.py` which will run the file
system program project that I have implemented.

3. After the running the program with the `pyhton pyremove.py` command, I will
then go through and explain what the output means in technical terms.

4. After explaining the output, I will ask if anyone in the audience has any questions
concerning my program or the output I provided.


I hope with this demonstration my colleagues will have a better understanding of how
a file system program can be implemented with the programming language Python. A key
takeaway I hope is taken away from this demonstration is how versatile the `os` module
is for creating operating systems projects. Without the `os` module, I do not believe
that i will be able to properly implement this program for my long term systems project.
I also would like individuals to see how much a user can show of the File Explorer that
is available in each operating system, MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
