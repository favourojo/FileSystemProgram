# Descriptive Title of the Project

## Favour Ojo

## Overview of the Project in At Least Two Paragraphs

For my project, I will be creating a Python script that will enable users to be
able to delete or insert files of any type into a directory. I would also like to
see if I am able to also have the user be able to delete full directories also
if they wish to. I chose this type of project because I wanted to expand more from
the lab we did early this semester than enabled us to copy file contents to other
utilizing the GO language. I wanted to see how a process like this can be done with
the Python language and if it is similar in any way.

There are several methods to go about completing a program that deletes
a directory / file utilizing Python. I believe the way I will probably go about
completing this program would be utilizing the os package that is available
in Python through the import modules. 

## List of OSTEP-Related Topics Connected to the Proposed Project

- Process Execution
- File Management

## Description of the Programming Languages and Software Tools Used in the Project

I will be utilizing Python for this project.

## Description of the Strategy You Will Adopt to Evaluate the Project

The strategy I have for this project would be to first conduct some research on
how other individuals completed this project. I am conducting research because I
believe that would be the best way to begin my project. After conducting research,
I will begin creating the source code for this final project. I will also study
the GO program that talks about copy file contents to other to see if there will
be any similarities between how this program would be executed in GO vs Python.


## Overview of the Evidence to Support Both the Feasibility and Challenge of the Project

I have been introduced to a project like this before in Operating Systems and I understand
the details and process of completing a project like this. However, I am not very knowledgeable
on the topic of being able to completely delete a file or directory without it causing severe
harm to the user's operating system by deleting files it should not have. I hope to be to tackle
this challenge without it becoming a problem to the completion of my project.

## Backup Plan that You Will Adopt if the Proposed Project is not Feasible

If I am unable to complete the project that I proposed, then I will try another idea I had for a project which was creating supervisors in Python with multi-threading and process manager. I am hoping that my project will be feasible and can be done.
