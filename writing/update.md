## Status Update for the Project in At Least Two Paragraphs

So far, I have been making steady progress in my Operating Systems final project. 
I have modified the topic and purpose of my project by adding the idea of being able 
to read into and creating directories with Python. I added this feature because I felt 
my project was lacking depth when it came to showing how Python utilizes the `os` module
to perform file / directory manipulation. After deciding to do that, I have a clearer idea 
on how to create a Python program that creates files, reads into directories, and also can delete
files and directories. Though I was able to add more depth to my Operating Systems project, I did run
in to a few challenges when I was trying to implement my project. 

The challenges I faced when trying to implement this program is trying to figure out 
the correct way to implement this program without causing severe damage to my file manager.
I am trying to figure out the best way to implement the deleting file feature / deleting 
directories feature in Python without accidentally deleting files that I did not intend to 
delete. I also am having a challenge with how I will continually run the program without having 
the same file being added several times into the directory I wish for it to be. I feel that we have
discussed in our previous lab sessions that we completed for the Operating Systems course. As of right now, 
I have made a good amount of progress and I hope to continue to make quality progress on my project.
